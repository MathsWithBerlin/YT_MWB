## Introduction to Dynamical Systems(By [Aritrabha Majumdar](https://paulpseudoman.github.io/))

It was a basic introductory course where we learnt about the following stuffs -

- Some Basic Linear Algebra 
- Stability of Ordinary Differential Equations
  - Linear Systems
  - Non-Linear Systems(Local Theory)
 

Also at the middle of the course I made a presentation on the [Spectral Theorem](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bnqrIGg4x6yNU18mimoggvLsltV1oL1Q/view?usp=sharing) .

Here are the notes [link](https://paulpseudoman.github.io/DSnotes.pdf) to the course.
