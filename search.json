I would like to share my views on it(COMING SOON !!). This course is being taught by Prof. Mathew Joseph.\n\n\n2.0.4 Elementary Number Theory\nHere are Assignments that were given to us as a Homework. The course was taken by Prof. Ramdin Mawia.\n\n\n2.0.5 Linear Algebra\nThis was without a doubt the best course in the 1st semester. I got to learn a lot of new stuff and got myself acquainted with proof writing and stuff like Resonance Articles. It was taken by Prof. Anita Naolekar.
