# Pro-BABLE

## Spread of Rumours
In a small town of n people a person passes a titbit
of information to another person. A rumour is now launched with each recipient of the information passing it on to a randomly chosen individual. What
is the probability that the rumour is told r times $\textbf{without}$ 
 
(a) returning to the originator,
 
(b) being repeated to anyone.
 
$\textbf{Generalisation}$: redo the calculations if
each person tells the rumour to m randomly selected people

## Increasing Seuence of Events

 Suppose $\set{A_n \vert n>1}$ is an increasing
 sequence of events such that , $A_n \subseteq A_{n+1}$ for each n . Let A = $\bigcup_{n=i}^\infty A_n$ .  Show that
 $P(A_n)$ $\rightarrow P(A)$ as n $\rightarrow \infty$ .


## Dice Game

 If three dice are thrown. What is the probability that one shows a
 6 given that no two show the same face? Repeat for n dice where $2 < n < 6$
