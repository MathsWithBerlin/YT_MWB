## Sem I @ isibang
These are some of the works, I did in my B.Math Journey.


### Real Analysis
I got some [Real Analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15aQW5bT4oBRqTgWve05l_CL1jxj97ieQ/view?usp=sharing) Notes for you all, by [Prof. BV Rajaram Bhatt](https://www.isibang.ac.in/~bhat/).

### Fundamentals of Computer Programming

We did this course under [Prof. Jishnu Gupta Biswas](https://isi.irins.org/profile/13204)
Here are a few resorces :-

1. OG Book for [C Programming](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JgIz5I723BBlrkGD4n0qE4n5U89LD3XY/view?usp=sharing)
2. My B.Math [FCP course link](https://www.isibang.ac.in/~adean/infsys/database/Bmath/FCP.html)

### Probability Theory
One of the favourite topics of my interest. I would like to share my views on it(COMING SOON !!).
This course is being taught by [Prof. Mathew Joseph](https://sites.google.com/view/mjoseph/home).

### Elementary Number Theory
Here are [Assignments](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a-w8kH7kZud-1WypK9IrwDW7UoYUFmZf/view?usp=sharing) that were given to us as a Homework. The course was taken by [Prof. Ramdin Mawia](https://sites.google.com/view/ramdinmawia/home).

### Linear Algebra
This was without a doubt the best course in the 1st semester. I got to learn a lot of new stuff and got myself acquainted with proof writing and stuff like Resonance Articles. It was taken by [Prof. Anita Naolekar](https://www.isibang.ac.in/~statmath/homepage.html).
Here is a [link](https://www.isibang.ac.in/~adean/infsys/database/Bmath/LAlg1.html) to the course page.
