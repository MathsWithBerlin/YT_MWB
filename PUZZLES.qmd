## Iterated Sine 

Consider the function $f_n(x)$ defined for positive integers $n$ and real numbers $x$ by 
$f_n(x) = \sin(\sin(\sin(\cdots (\sin x)))),$
with $n$ applications of the sine function. Thus 
$f_2(x) = \sin(\sin x), \quad f_3(x) = \sin(\sin(\sin x)),$
and so on.

Let $x \in (0, \pi/2)$ be chosen, and let the sequence 
$f_1(x), f_2(x), f_3(x), \dots, f_{100}(x),$
be computed. It is found that for each fixed $x$ and for all sufficiently large $n$, we have 
$f_n(x) \approx \sqrt{\frac{3}{n}}.$
How may this phenomenon be explained?
